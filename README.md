To begin comment out the script tag linking to `index.min.js` in the html file.
Write your code in `challenge.js`

## Deliverables

1. As a user, I should see the timer increment every second once the page has loaded
  My thoughts:
    you need the counter
    some way to set an interval
    some way to wait for page to load before interval starts -->
2. As a user, I can manually increment and decrement the counter as I like
  Thoughts:

    add event listener on click on buttons to increase and decrease

3. As a user, I can like an individual number of the counter. I should see the appropriate number of likes associated with that particular number
    Thoughts:
      -keep track of how many likes each number gets
      

4. As a user I can pause the game, which should disable all buttons except the pause button, which should now show the text 'resume'

**if we have time:**
5. As a user I can leave comments on my gameplay, such as "Wow, what a fun game this is"
